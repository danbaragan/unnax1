This should be an assignment described by Test.pdf
Note however that I misread the first few lines and did not harvest data from 
http://test.unnax.com/
Instead I created the backend database part.
Since I figured this out very late I decided to let it be;
It is actually a more complex assignment than the required one.


I have created:
- database model for the problem and the actual database
- a secure way to store user passwords
- a small tst suite to know that things are ok (helped me TDD)
- the script that reads from my database (not the web page you provided)

If you want to take a look here are the steps

1. Have linux/macos environment. This was not tested nor intented to be run under windows
2. Have python3 (I have used 3.7 but 3.6 should sufice) and the coresponding pip
3. Have virtualenv
4. virtualenv -p python3 .env
5. . .env/bin/activate
6. pip install -r requirements.txt
7. python -m pytest -vv # various unit tests
8. ./read.py --username Y3216434F --password pperez2018 # the main testcase
